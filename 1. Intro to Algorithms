1.what is Algorithm-

set of well defined instructions to solve a problem

Time and Space Complexity-



Time Complexity - Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size


Space Complexity - Amount of memory taken by an algorithm as a function of input size.


By evaluating against the input size, the analysis is not only machine independent but the comparison is also more appropriate

How to represent complexity-

asymptotic notations - mathematical tools for represent time and space complexity

1. Big O Notation - worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation - best case complexity
3.Theta Notaion- average case complexity
